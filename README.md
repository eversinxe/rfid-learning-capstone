# rfid-learning-capstone
For my project I am going to be implementing RFID learning in order to create a contactless payment that people could use when out at restaurants/bars. In order to achieve this, a website will need to be made in order to create a database for the customers that will be using the device as well as the businesses that are including this form of payment.
