# rfid-learning-capstone
For my project I am going to be implementing RFID learning in order to create a contactless payment that people could use when out at restaurants/bars. In order to achieve this, a website will need to be made in order to create a database for the customers that will be using the device as well as the businesses that are including this form of payment. As well as the use of a Raspberry Pi in order to scan the RFID chips within the bracelet. 


# AWS Personal Encryption
For this idea, I was thinking of going the route of developing a personal encryption for software. To get started on encrypting I would use the Amazon Web services as it is easily accessible. I am interested in this topic as privacy and security are my biggest concerns when coming to my devices.
